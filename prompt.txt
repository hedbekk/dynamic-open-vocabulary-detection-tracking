List all unique types of objects in the image, including background objects. Output the result as a Python dictionary. Each key should be a concise but descriptive phrase that clearly differentiates the object from others. Phrases may include attributes such as color, shape, size, texture and material, to improve clarity. The corresponding value should be a short, one- or two-word unique label (no underscores). Group very similar items under a single entry and avoid redundant or overly specific distinctions.
